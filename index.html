         <h1>HARSHIT BRAR</h1>
         <p>
             my name harshit.My age 15 and my favourite sport in playing <b><i>cricket</i></b> and<b><i> football.</i></b>
         </p>
         <p>
             i have created many games,one of which is the following named balloon-buster<br/>
             in this game you have to move the bow vertically up and down accordingly with the height of the balloon which will come randomly,you have to just hit the balloon with the arrow and gain points.

         <p>
             i have my second production:-<br/>
             in this game you need tyo click the space button to start the game.Once started,the ball will hit the paddle the wil move towards the block of bricks.one the ball hits the brick,it will disappear.<br/>
             all you have to do is that disappear all the bricks and not let the ball miss the paddle.i have full faith on you,but still i have provided you with 3 lives,after that,<b><u>GAME OVER</u></b>

                 this will be my last for today,but not of my life:-<br/>
                 in this,this will not exactly be a game but you can call this as an future time tocker or clock is better.<br/>
                 i have included 3 bight colours,and i am sure that you will guess that which colour is used for whick variable(hour,minute & time)
